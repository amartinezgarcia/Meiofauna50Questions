Abstract
Meiofauna—a collective term to define microscopic animals—represent an important component of Earth’s biodiversity, play critical roles in biogeochemical cycles and serve as models for adaptation and genomic research across the Tree of Life. Here, we provide a community horizon scan and identify the top-50 priority questions for meiofaunal research. We encourage an agenda that balances amongst investigating general questions, addressing more specialised research topics, and generating primary data. Integrative approaches and technological advances are indeed creating opportunities to employ meiofauna to answer broader questions, despite impediments related to their small body size. The geographical and taxonomic biases that have historically affected meiofaunal research can be alleviated by promoting international cooperation, open data sharing, and an increased effort in education, taxonomic training, as well as scientific communication to scientific and non-scientific audiences. These steps unlock the potential of meiofauna to contribute more fully to global biodiversity, ecological, and biogeochemical research.
